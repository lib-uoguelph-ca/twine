The ripple effect describes the phenomenon that each one of our decisions and actions have its own effect on the world around us. We are not defined by these decisions, but it can be beneficial to be aware of the choices we make and the consequences that they may lead to.

This game will take you to a hypothetical world where each choice changes the next (just like our own world).

You control the world&#39;s fate! You will make decisions that will lead our world into different directions.

You don&#39;t like your result, play again. Or if you want to see the alternative option, play again and change up your answers. 

This is your opportunity to create a future that you would want to live in. What would you do if you were in control?

Have fun, but use what you may learn here and apply it to your own life.

Oh, and I hope you&#39;re ready for time travel!

The final bell rings.

On your walk home from school, you begin to think about what Mrs. Murner said. You look around at the big trees, clear sky, and can smell the pine. You can also see the overflowing garbage cans, cut down tree stumps, and used surgical masks on the ground.

&quot;More homes in danger and at risk of being destroyed due to the rising sea levels&quot; says the news reporter on the screen. 

They continue, &quot;Not only has this affected numerous animal species, this is continuing to be a problem for us&quot;. The crowd lets out a sigh in unison.

&quot;As we&#39;ve seen in the past&quot;, the reporter continues, &quot;the increase in natural disasters has affected us all, and we encourage citizens to confirm their emergency exit plans with their families&quot;.

It has been like this for years now. Scientists say that people 100 years ago could have prevented this from happening, but not enough people took it seriously.

You [[turn the corner]].

This was an exaggerated view of what our future may look like if we continue to make mistakes and not prioritize climate change.

I hope this game encouraged you to be more conscious of the decisions you make and how they may be affecting our future.
